 <center><h1>Shrek Movies and Their Superiority</h1></center>
<center><p>Shrek as a movie series started in 2001, and has been a powerhouse for Dreamwork Studios ever since. They have come out with a total of 4 movies that have created a legacy like no other. This series also inspired TV shows such as DreamWorks Shrek's Swamp Stories and Puss & Boots. Shrek is one of the only movies that is family friendly and is still funny to people of any age. Anyone that disagrees is mistaken and will regret their decision.</p></center>

<p>Although controversial, the first Shrek movie for me is what all of the other Shrek movies aspire to be. It is what starts the story and sets up the other 3 movies that follow. Despite enjoying 2 alot, 3 got the edge due to the comedy and character development throughout the movie that was slightly better than 2's. 4, although good, just did not do enough to put itself into the top 3.</p>

<p>Many Shrek fans say that 2 is the best movie due to it's colorful secondary characters and relatable plot. Although true, it does not hold the same weight that the first movie did in terms of originality and starting of the series. The humor did retain the classic Shrek feel though which made it a great movie overall.</p>

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>The first movie of the Shrek series started out by introducing the main character, Shrek. Lord Farquad, a want to be king, sends tons of fairy tale creatures to occupy Shrek's land. This upsets Shrek and leads him on an adventure with Donkey to rid his swamp of unwanted visitors. Farquad tells Shrek to find Princess Fiona and return her to him, which leads Shrek to a multitude of challenges to overcome. These included getting through a dangerous castle guarded by a not so friendly dragon. Once Shrek acquires the princess, they head back to Lord Farquad where he plans to marry Fiona but Shrek interrupts the marriage. This leads Fiona to turn into an ogre in front of everyone, which forces her and Shrek to escape the castle. The movie ends with Shrek and Fiona's becoming married and having a honeymoon.</p> <hr>

<h3>Shrek 2</h3>
<p>Shrek 2 starts out right where the first movie ended, with Shrek and his new wife returning to the swamp. To their suprise (and annoyance) Donkey shows back up and pesters them. The two ogres then recieve an invitation from Fiona's parents to come visit their kingdom of Far Far Away. Despite their doubts, they decide to go on an extremly long carriage ride in which Donkey is an incredible annoyance. Once arriving, Fiona's parents and their kingdom are horrified to find out Fiona and her new husband are beasts. Fairy god mother comes into the movie by reminding Fiona's father that she was supposed to marry her son, Prince Charming, instead of marrying Shrek. This leads Harold (the father) to hire an assassin (Puss In Boots) to take out Shrek. This attempt fails, so the god mother instructs the father to give Fiona a love potion, which he decides not to. This leads Fiona to headbutt Prince Charming during the wedding and reunite with Shrek. Oh and Donkey and the scary dragon had babies.</p> <hr>

<h3>Shrek the 3rd</h3>
<p>The third movie in the series is introduced with Harold falling ill and dying. This makes Shrek the immediate successor of the throne, which is something he does not want to happen. This leads Shrek to search for the only other option, cousin Artie (a distant cousin). As Shrek, Donkey, and Puss & Boots sail off, Fiona runs to the edge of the dock and yells to Shrek that she is pregnant, which shocks Shrek. As the three are gone, Prince Charming convinces a bunch of villians to help him raid/take over the kingdom. Shrek retrieves Artie from his boarding school and end up crashing the boat on the way back. Here they meet an old wizard, Marlin, who ends up sending them back to Far Far Away after getting attacked by some of Captain Hooks men. Once Shrek and his comrades return to the kingdom, they are captured and Shrek is chained up to be in Charming's play. In the end Artie convinces the villians to become nice and continues the throne of Far Far Away. Fiona and Shrek go back to their swamp with their three children.</p> <hr>

<h3>Shrek Forever After</h3> 
<p>The final movie of the four is the revenge of Rumpelstilskin, someone who was so close to being king but got denied by Shrek saving Fiona. Rumpelstilskin tricks Shrek into signing a contract where he gives up his memory of being born so he no longer exists. This puts Shrek in an alternate universe where the only way to break the contract is by kissing Fiona, who is the leader of the resistance. This leads Rumpelstilskin to hire a bounty hunter, Pied Piper, to prevent this from happening. Shrek and Fiona get away from the bounty hunters attempt to capture them, but Shrek eventually goes back to the castle to confront Rumplestilskin. Shrek is captured, but his new found ogre friends save him and eventually the contract is broken. Shrek is truly happily ever after.</p> <hr>

<p>Although the Shrek movies do surround around Shrek at all times, Donkey is atop my list of best main characters. Donkey throughout all 4 movies acts as a great source of comedic relief and provides a type of outgoing energy unlike any other character. Despite being annoying at times, he is such an easy character to relate to and enjoy at all times. Shrek is an amazing character as well, and is someone we as an audience get to understand more than any other character. This is because of all 4 movies revolving around him, so we get a further look into his thoughts and emotions. This allows for us to appreciate and sympathize some of the actions he does through the movies.</p>
<p>Puss In Boots is a character that was incredibly popular after his big time appearance in Shrek 2. So popular in fact he got a TV show and 3 movies made just for him! He is such a dynamic character because we see his shift from "assassin" to a cute cat who becomes friends with Shrek. Fiona is a character that is essential to the plot but is not as enjoyable as the other 3 characters mentioned. Her humor was not on the same level as other characters in the movie and she seemed out of place at times, but still a good character.</p>

<h2>Best Supporting Characters Ranked</h2>

<img src=https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/shrek/images/1/14/Dragon_Shrek_Forever_2.png/revision/latest?cb=20120203213052 alt=dragon pic width=200 style="float: right">

<li>Dragon</li>
<li>Prince Charming</li>
<li>Gingerbread Man</li>
<li>Lord Farquaad</li>

<p>Dragon flew onto the scene in the first Shrek movie and was the main obstacle Shrek faced before saving Fiona from the tower. Donkey ends up befriending her to distract her from Fiona's escape and quickly becomes a fan favorite. In Shrek the third it is revealed that they have Dronkeys (Dragon Donkeys) which shows their affection for one another. Prince Charming, who becomes the antagonist in Shrek 2, wants the throne. He ends up constantly trying to mess with the main characters but he is a complete person with an entertaining personality. </p>
<p>The gingerbread man first comes about in Shrek when he gets interrogated by Lord Farquaad. Then later in Shrek the third we learn more about how he came to be and his traumatic dating life. He may be small but provides a lot to the story. Lord Farquaad himself is just a cocky character with an unlikeable personality. the character itself is not bad but he is not someone the audience is intended to like.</p>

<h3>Summary of the greatest movies ever made</h3>
<p>Shrek is a movie that provides a great story line along with comedy that is humorous to all ages. The characters are all complete with some kind of background that allows us to understand them better. I think that Shrek is a movie that will stand the test of time for generations to come. I am excited for the rumored 5th Shrek but I hope they do not mess it up.</p>
